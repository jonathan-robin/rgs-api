# RG STATS - API 
This is the server-side of a web API [rgstats](https://github.com/jonathan-robin/rgs-client.git). The app displays any male tennis match played at the French Open, Roland Garros, since 1968.

The website allows you to search between 4 filters ;
- Any complete draw from 1968 to 2019.
- Players profile with statistics and every match played. 
- Select a player and add filters (year, round)
- Pet peeve
